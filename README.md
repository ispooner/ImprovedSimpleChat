# ImprovedSimpleChat
A very different base for the chat app. This one simply adds the ability to add people to the chat. It also simplifies the chat layout and uses the intent to pass the current user to the chat. That user is then credited with all of their messages. From here there are many improvements that could be made. Such as decorating the chat log to have various niceties like colored message boxes and user based formatting. 

There are also some things I need to do to pretty up the app and the code. But those are for another time.
